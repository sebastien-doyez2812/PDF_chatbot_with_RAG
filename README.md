# AI Agent using LangChain and Ollama

## Description
This repository contains the code for an AI agent that utilizes **LangChain** and **Ollama** to search for information within PDFs stored in the `docs` folder and provide precise answers to user questions.

The project includes both the **backend** for the AI agent and the **data processing pipeline** to populate the **vector database**.

## Installation & Usage

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py
```
This command will launch the backend and serve the frontend.

### Test the Agent:

```

### Frontend
A simple HTML page is included in the `www` folder to interact with the AI agent.
